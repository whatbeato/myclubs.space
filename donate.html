            <h2>donate us money :p</h2>
            <p>okay so basically, quick back story:</p>
            <p>hi! my name is lynn, i've been a hack clubber since nov 2024, and ever since then, i've gotten more and more involved in the community.</p>
            <p>i went from being just a random hack clubber, to a hackathon organizer, to a contractor at hack club, and then an intern! (ps: i was an intern for the 2025 summer season)</p>
            <p>geniunely, i can't thank this community enough. it's done a ton of shit to me, and i know it's done a shit ton to other people. (read tw below)</p>
            <details>
                <summary>tw: suicide, sh (open to read)</summary>
                <p>from speaking to parents of hack clubbers, and hack clubbers themselves, i've heard that hack club has prevented them from comitting suicide,</p>
            </details>
            <p>even though i am a hack club contractor, i fund this mostly out of pocket, which is why I ask you for a donation ðŸ˜­</p>
        </div>
        <div id="transparency">
            <h2>for what will i use these funds?</h2>
            <p>this money will mostly be used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fund new domains (vendor: porkbun)</li>
                <li>fund the bare metal server we're using (vendor: OVHCloud)</li>
                <li>possibly, in the future, fund Google Workspace or a seperate email server.</li>
                <li>fund domains (not subdomains) for clubs as a prize for their work! (to be planned)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="donate">
            <h2>yap, yap. yap. how do i donate?</h2>
            <p>i use HCB (if you're a hack clubber, i assume you know what HCB is) to collect donations and manage the financials of this</p>
