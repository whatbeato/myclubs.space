# yaht - yet another html template

this was originally made for myclubs.space, a service i run for clubs, but i geniunely liked how this came out, so I decided to make this kinda like an html template for myself!

features:
- silly blog
- nothing else really
- redirect system
- yeah that's about it tbh

## how to deploy it
1. choose your prefered hosting provider (vercel, etc.)
2. deploy it
3. no more config needed lmfao, just customize it!
