# yaht - yet another html template

this was originally made for myclubs.space, a service i run for clubs, but i geniunely liked how this came out, so I decided to make this kinda like an html template for people that want a simple portfolio :3

## features:
- none interesting
- sleek design i guess :P
- blog that reads from .md files!

uh yeah! this was made for the athena award btw :D it's really awesome
