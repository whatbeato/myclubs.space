        <h2>welcome to myclubs.space! (my club's space)</h2>
        <h3>this is basically a subdomain "service" for your <a href="https://hackclub.com">hack club</a> that let's you host your club's website!</h3>
        <p>it's free to use, opensource and community ran (note: current maintainer <a href="https://lynn.pt/">(lynn)</a> works at hack club)</p>
        <p>it's managed in europe :D, your club's website gets it's own docker container, it's awesome :D</p>
    </div>
    <div id="why">
        <h2>ok, nice idea, but why?</h2>
        <p>honestly, i love dino.icu, but a few more subdomain options dedicated for clubs would be nice, wouldn't it? and making it easier for club leaders to get their websites up and running too!</p>
        <p>also, we got some nice features!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>easy to sign up</li>
            <li>no downtime, monitored (99.9%)</li>
            <li>multiple subdomain options:</li>

                    <li>hshack.club</li>
                </ul>
            <li>works with most HTML+CSS+JS websites, React, Astro, Next.js, etc.</li>
            <li>possibly sometime soon, free email!</li>
