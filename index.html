        <h1>introduction!</h1>
        <p>hi, i'm lynn! i'm a portugal-based teen that codes sometimes, organizes events (currently organizing atlÃ¢nticohacks) and dabbles in some photography and videography</p>
        <p>you've probably seen me in the hack club slack, RTP/SIC, instagram, if you somehow got my photos featured, but i'm just a silly goober to be honest</p>
        <p>interested in hiring me? i'm not available for hire at the moment. i'm currently only doing work for hack club and myself.</p>

            <p>on june 2025, i travelled to burlington, vt from lisbon, portugal to go to hack club hq and volunteer for 1 month, and it was the best month of my life. knowing that this non-profit would invite me and pay for my flight and stuff was so surprising and i couldn't be more thankful!</p>
            <p>i met a ton new people, and that was awesome. yet again, thank you hack club <3</p>
