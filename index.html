            <p>on june 2025, i travelled to burlington, vt from lisbon, portugal to go to hack club hq and volunteer for 1 month, and it was the best month of my life. knowing that this non-profit would invite me and pay for my flight and stuff was so surprising and i couldn't be more thankful!</p>
