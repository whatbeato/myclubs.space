    <div id="why">
        <h2>ok, nice idea, but why?</h2>
        <p>honestly, i love dino.icu, but a few more subdomain options dedicated for clubs would be nice, wouldn't it? and making it easier for club leaders to get their websites up and running too!</p>
        <p>also, we got some nice features!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>easy to sign up</li>
            <li>no downtime (99.9%)</li>
            <li>multiple subdomain options:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>schoolhack.club</li>

                    <li>hackclub.website</li>
                </ul>
            <li>works with most HTML+CSS+JS websites, React, Astro, Next.js, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>there's so many more features, that i geniunely can't list them all</p>
